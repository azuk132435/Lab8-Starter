## Question:
Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related as they both work to make the user experience better by making sure functionality works despite bad conditions.
Graceful degradation allows an application to work at a basic level when the more advanced stuff isn't available. Similarly service workers give a way to make sure that 
web applications work even when there is no internet, by chaching files and serving them from the cache. They both work hand in hand to provide access to applicaitons despite external factors
that could be hindering.
